# Data Visualization Dashboard using MERN Stack
This project utilizes the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack to create a robust data visualization dashboard. It includes various visualizations such as Area Chart, Stacked Bar Chart, Pie Chart, Bullet Graph, Gantt Chart, Zig Zag Chart, and Timeline to provide insightful analytics based on data fetched from a MongoDB database.

# Key Features:
  ## Data Visualization
  Utilizes D3.js and React Simple Charts for creating visually appealing and informative charts.
  ## Dashboard Filters
  Includes filters for End Year, Topics, Sector, Region, PEST, Source, SWOT, Country, and City to customize data views.
  ## API Integration
  Node.js backend serves as an API endpoint to fetch data from MongoDB, ensuring dynamic updates and seamless data flow.          
  ## Creative Visualizations
  Generates creative visual insights from data, enhancing data-driven decision-making.
